This folder contains the code for our website:
[https://cds-registration.lfenergy.org/](https://cds-registration.lfenergy.org/)


## How to run your own copy of this website

* On Ubuntu 24.04+ or Debian 13+, install `jekyll`.

```
sudo apt install jekyll
```

* Navigate to this website's folder in the repo.

```
cd website/
```

* Copy the specifications from the base repo folder to the website include folder.

```
cp ../specifications/cds-wg1-01.md _includes/spec_copies/placeholder_cds-wg1-01.md
cp ../specifications/cds-wg1-02.md _includes/spec_copies/placeholder_cds-wg1-02.md
```

* Run the jekyll server, which builds the website and starts serving it on https://localhost:4000/

```
jekyll serve
```

* Done!

**Note:** If you want to make changes to the specifications themselves (to make a pull request, etc.), you need to modify them in the `specifications/` folder, not the `spec_copies/` folder.
Then, you will need to re-copy them to the `spec_copies/` folder for the changes to show up on your local website.
Finally, when you're done with your changes, you need to commit changes in the `specifications/` folder and not commit any changes to the `spec_copies/` folder.
Our automated build process for the official website will automatically copy over the specifications when a new version is built.
