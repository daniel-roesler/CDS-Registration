# CDS Registration Working Group (WG1)

This is the homepage of the [Registration Working Group (WG1)](https://github.com/lfe-cds/CDS-Registration),
part of the
[Connected Data Specifications (CDS)](https://cds.lfenergy.org/),
an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

## Scope <a id="scope" href="#scope" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

This repository is dedicated to the CDS Registration Working Group. We focus on writing free, open specifications for
utilities and other central entities to provide discovery, registration, connectivity, and profile management
abilities to third party entities.

## Use Cases <a id="use-cases" href="#use-cases" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

We have defined several broad categories of [use cases]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}) we will focus on addressing,
along with what connectivity protocols will need to be specified to accommodate those use cases.

* `Use Case 1` - [Enabling Initial Configuration for Communication Protocols]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#initial-configuration)
* `Use Case 2` - [Enabling Configuration Management for Communication Protocols]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#configuration-management)

We've also made a list of what data and functionality is specifically [not in scope]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#not-in-scope).

## Specifications <a id="specs" href="#specs" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

These are the official [specifications]({{ "/specs" | relative_url }}) written by this working group.

* `CDS-WG1-01` - Server Metadata [[Overview]({{ "/specs/cds-wg1-01/overview" | relative_url }})] [[Specification]({{ "/specs/cds-wg1-01" | relative_url }})] `(in progress)`
* `CDS-WG1-02` - Client Registration [[Overview]({{ "/specs/cds-wg1-02/overview" | relative_url }})] [[Specification]({{ "/specs/cds-wg1-02" | relative_url }})] `(in progress)`

If you would like to contribute to these specifications, please see our docs on [Contributing]({{ "/" | relative_url }}#contributing) and [Design Principles]({{ "specs/design-principles" | relative_url }}).
